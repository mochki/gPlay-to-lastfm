Utility to push up you listening history from Google Play Music to Last.FM

Uhh, do the separate steps. I'm too lazy to details this out. Also, ended up doing 50 track increments manually because it wasn't hard and I was done working on this.

Your .env file should look like:

```
email=
password=

LAST_FM_APP_NAME=
LAST_FM_API_KEY=
LAST_FM_SECRET=
LAST_FM_USERNAME=
LAST_FM_SESSION_KEY=
```

Great, I'm going to go do something else with my weekend
